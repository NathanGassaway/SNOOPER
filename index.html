				<li>It stresses a closer connection between the reader and the maker. It
					hopes to emphasis this relationship through self- publishing, printing, binding and sending the magazine
					out on request. SNOOPER is a starting point to provoke and discuss demands of communication such as
					addressability and a physical halt. A snooper is a person who looks into other peoples stuff, kind of
					sneaking around and seeing/ reading things they are not supposed to. Exploring ‘unknown’ territories and
					dipping into something without previous knowledge. Snooping seems to be about curiosity and the
					slippage between naivety and ignorance. Its a non-exposed activity, including kind of shady methods of
					gathering information. A snooper is seen as both, a conspiracy creator and a truthful revealer. - SNOOPER
					will be organic and open in its format in a sense that different approaches will be asked to contribute to
					an issue. Furthermore each issue will snoop into different spatial concepts as sort of structural
					containers for new attitudes.
